													<p>Knowing only a few pages or posts on your site might ever rank well. The importance of backlinks can’t be stressed enough. Focus as much of your time as possible on the promotion of your content. It’s common for a large proportion of your overall organic search traffic to come from a very small proportion of your overall content. Without doubt, the biggest cause of failure with SEO campaigns is the assumption that simply creating great content will get you results. *Failing to adjust. Once upon a time, your first shot at SEO may have yielded solid results. Now, making a serious and strategic attempt at SEO is the starting point. I see this situation frequently, for example: if you’re not ranking for that perfect keyword yet, go after a new one. Don’t lose sight of those great keywords, but don’t sit around thinking your site will magically start ranking for it if it hasn’t yet. You have to pursue, in the meanwhile, related additional longer-tail, less competitive phrases, which help you gain ground in tackling higher trafficked terms. *SEO is more than just plugging holes. This is not as easy as plugging holes. It is more than that.SEO just takes more things coming together. You have to identify, and work the opportunities, as much as you have to plug holes. *The magic is in the maintenance. It is rarely the one-time work that will meet your goals and expectations. When you lay the SEO foundation on your website—selecting keywords, undergoing the rigorous, yet important minutiae of on-page optimization, redirecting and site speed and other technical obstacles—that used to be all it took. Today, it is the starting point. *Reality checking your budget. do you have the time and money to invest? It will require a mix of both. And when I say “both” I mean “both.” You cannot get results by throwing money at the problem. SEO, especially initially, requires an investment of dollars and a mix of people of strategists, tactical doers, and purse-string holders.

									<h3 class="major">What is the difference between SEO and SEM?</h3>
									<p>The difference of seo and sem is that seo optimizes search engine to give the best results to clients while the sem has a marketing process with a goal of getting more visibility in search engines either by getting more free traffic or paid traffic engines which means it gives results but more likely to deal with business to clients and encourages clients to buy product selling on the internet.

									The difference between SEO and SEM is simply that Search Engine Optimization is part of Search engine marketing or Search marketing as it is widely known. Both processes aim in increasing visibility in search engines.
SEO is about optimizing your website to get better rankings in the search results while SEM goes beyond SEO. It involves other methods that can get you more search engine visitors like PPC advertising.

											<h3 class="major">HOW TO SET REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS FOR YOUR SEO CAMPAIGN</h3>
											<p>There's a fine line between eagerness and impatience, and SEO is a strategy where that line is particularly fuzzy. Your first job is to remember that search engine optimization is a long-term campaign that should be grounded in long-term goals. Trying to achieve immediate numbers is an exercise in futility.</p>
